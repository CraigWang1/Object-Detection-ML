# Object-Detection-ML

Here you will find links and tutorials for how to train ML models, which detect objects from the sub.

Todo:
- add step by step tutorial (labelling, cleaning up dataset, training, inferencing, exporting) with links to code and colab embedded
- add limitations of current model, what we want in a new model
- add contact info (craig, phoebe for filtering, emil (alumni))
